Introduction X-Ray   crystallographic   analysis   is   a   powerful   method   to   provide   direct   information   on   molecular   structures   at   atomic   level.   This   core technique provides   structural   details   such   as molecular   arrangements   and bond   lengths.   It   can be used not only as a characterization tools for synthetic chemist determining the precise chemical   arrangements, but also play an important role in understanding the physical nature and the materials by studying its   various weak intermolecular interactions between molecules.Crystal   Engineering   has   grown   and   developed   over   the   past   50   years,   which   is   related   to   the   understanding   of   intermolecular interactions in crystal packing and use this knowledge to   design   new   crystalline   solids   with   desired   physical and chemical properties. It can be classified into two main areas: Study   of   (1)   Coordination Networks and   (2) Molecular Materials.
Coordination Networks,   commonly   known   as   metal   organic   frameworks   (MOF)   or   porous   coordination   network   (PCN),   consist   of ultrahigh   porosity   and   enormous   internal   surface   areas   ranges   from    1-D   to   3-D   coordination polymers.   By   combining   two   components,   metal   ion   or   cluster   and   organic   linker,   the   structure   of the   porous   materials can be readily engineered in composition, structure and functionality. Their interesting properties include   wide range of   important applications include gas storages, separation   and   sensing.Molecular   Materials   involves   the   studying   of polymorphs   and   co-crystals.   Polymorphs   refer   to   the   same   type   of   materials   that   can   form   two   or   more   crystal   packing   while   co-crystals   refer   to   two   or   more   types   of   molecular   or ionic   compound   crystallize   in   a   single   crystalline   phase   in   a   particular   stoichiometric   ratio.   They   both   play   an   important   role   in   pharmaceutical   formulation   as   their   solubility,   bioavailability,   solid-state   stability   is   greatly   depending on their structures.In this   experiment, the   study   of   pharmaceutical   co-crystals and metal   Organic Frameworks   were   demonstrated   by   two    systems    via    solvothermal    synthesis:    (1)    Synthesis    of    Caffeine:4-hydroxybeznoic    acid    co-crystal    and    (2)   Synthesis   of   zeolitic   imidazolate   frameworks   (ZIF).Caffeine, a worldwide mostly used pharmaceutical model   compound, was heavily   studied   as   a   psychoactive   drug.   Researches   shows   its   pharmaceutical   performance   can   be   greatly   improved   via   co-crystal   phase   formation   with   aromatic carboxylic   acids   (1)   .   The interaction always involves   one   of   more   heterosynthon   hydrogen   bond   between acid and caffeine imidazole moiety. In this   experiment,   the   system   Caffeine:4-hydroxybeznoic   acid   is   chosen   as   it   can   form   both   1:2   and   2:1   co-crystal   with   change   of condition.   Different   supermolecular   heterosynthons   can   be   examined in the structural isomers and reveal the impact of   structural variation.Zeolitic   imidazolate   frameworks   (ZIF)   are   known   as   analogues   of   SiO2.   Various porous   materials   can   be   readily   engineered for   composition,   structure   and functionality with different   reaction   conditions.   In   this   experiment, two   3-D networks, SOD topology (ZIF-8) and quartz topology, will be synthesized (2)   . SOD topology (ZIF-8) consist of   large cavities   which is   useful for solvent/gas absorption application,   w代 写CHMS 5201 & 5202: Anal Instrumentation Lab I & II Experiment 9C/C++

Experimental Procedure 
A. Preparation of Crystalline Samples 
Since   most   part-time   students   are   unable   to   prepare   these,   several   different   materials   will   be   prepared   for   later   analysis that all groups will use.
General Solvothermal Synthesis 
1.         Place all the mixture into   Teflon cup   (Day   1)
2.       Introduce corresponding   solvents   into the   Teflon   cup   (Day   1)
3.       Place Teflon cup   in   stainless   steel   container   and   seal   container   (Day   1)
4.       Place container +   Teflon   cup   into   oven   at   80/110oC   for various   durations   (Day   1)

Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (Day 2) 
Crystals will be mounted for quick checking of   the suitability of   the crystal for   analysis   and unit   cell   determination   maybe carried out.The choice of   ideal crystal – size, habit and singularity will be discussed.   Crystals maybe   glued to   a   glass   fiber   for mounting   on   the   diffractometer,   or   immersed   in   paratone   liquid   before   freezing.   Each   group   member   will   be   responsible for one   sample.
